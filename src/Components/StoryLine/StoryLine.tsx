        1. On a prosperous grassland located in the deep meta-prairies, a tiny village of fisherman
        gather together around a beautiful, deep river to fish $TROUT. <br />
        2. The high abundance of $TROUT in the river attracts fishermen to the village. <br />
        3. However, this is not without danger; this rich, bountiful river attracts not only
        fishermen but animals of all sorts, including heinous bears! <br />
        4. The bears are on the hunt to find all the fishermen and their precious delicious $TROUT!
        They will acquire it by any means necessary! <br />
        5. To counter these aggressive attacks, the fisherman have decided to start offering a small
        portion of their composed $TROUT to the bears <br />
        6. Although, when a fisherman aimlessly moves away from the river alone, or when a new
        fisherman is born, the bears all lose control. <br />
        7.The bears don’t hold back and there is no way to repress them!

        . There will only ever be 10,498 Gen X, minted for 0.069420 ETH each. The 39,502 Gen Y are
        minted by farming $TROUT. <br />
        . Fishermen can be staked on the river to earn $TROUT and pay a tax anytime they claim their
        $TROUT. <br />
        . If a Fishermen is unstaked from the river, the Bears try to steal all of its accumulated
        $TROUT. <br />. When a new Fisherman is born, the Bears attempt to steal it. If they’re
        successful, it’s given to a randomly selected bear instead of the owner who minted it.
